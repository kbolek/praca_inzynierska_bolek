The messages which are being sending from the computer:

The main messages:
TMP+RTD+xxxx - the RTD value which in the future will be necessery to compute the ratio and the resistance of the PT100
TMP+VAL+xx.xx - the value of the temperature which comes from thermo.temperature function beased on RNOMINAL and RREF

The fault messahes:
TMP+HIGH+ - the information about RTD High Threshold
TMP+LOW+ - the information about RTD low threshold
TMP+REFINM+ - REFIN- > 0.85 x Bias
TMP+RTDINM+ - REFIN- < 0.85 x Bias - FORCE- open
TMP+VOL+ - RTDIN- < 0.85 x Bias - FORCE- open
TMP+UOVOL+ - Under/Over voltage
