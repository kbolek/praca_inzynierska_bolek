## Current measurement

The description of the library functions:

>bool INA219_begin(TwoWire *theWire = &Wire);

The function prototype of the library's begin function. It is responsible for connecting the INA219 sensor witch microcontroller (Arduino) by I2C.
It returns type boolean with a parameter of type TwoWire* that has a default value of &Wire.

The address of the device is assigned to macro INA219_ADDRESS and for INA219 is 0x40. 

>void setCalibration_16V_1A();

The function sets up the parameters of the INA219 measurement like:

1. Bus voltage range values.
2. Value for gain bit.
3. Value for bus ADC resolution.
4. Value for shunt ADC resolution.
5. Value for shunt ADC resolution.

>int16_t read_voltage_reg();

The function simply reads the value of the shunt voltage register by I2C. 

>void callib_voltage(int16_t measured_voltage_mv);

The function determines the voltage coefficient by division of actual measured voltage (by accurate multimeter) and voltage appointed by the value of the shunt voltage register (multiply by 0.01 because of the constant Shunt Volatge LSB of 10ÂµV). 
The coefficient then is saving in the EEPROM using put () EEPROM library function which **writes out a set of bytes** using the update function which allow to write out a float object.

> float read_voltage();

The function return the voltage in mili volts which is determined by actuall value read in the voltage register and multiply by the coefficient designated in the callib

>void callib_current(int16_t measured_current_ma);
>
>float read_current();
